# covid_infoVis

This is my final, inspired by Hans Rosling (https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen)

- 2 main functions: Interactive Map browsing and Cirle plots. 
- Innitial loading will take some seconds.

# How to run (Only tested on Ubuntu focal):
## convenient way (will also work on Windows):
- You can use IntelliJ ultimate and run main.html (community version will be updated latter)
## A little bit "urgh, okay" way:
- Dependency: python in your PATH.
- Type in local git folder (covid_infoVis): ```python -m http.server ```
- Go to link that the terminal output. Choose main.html.
